# Neural Network Experiments

## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation, description, and results of four experiments involving Feedforward and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural networks. The experiments are conducted on two selected datasets: Palmer Penguins and Heart Disease.

## Experiments Overview

1. **Description of Datasets:**
   - Palmer Penguins
   - Heart Disease

2. **Data Preparation:**
   - **Initial Data Processing:**
     - Describe the preprocessing steps applied to the datasets.
     - Explain how the data was formatted for input into the networks.
   - **Data Splitting:**
     - Discuss the division of the data into training, testing, and validation sets.
     - Justify the chosen split and consider the impact on the network architecture.

3. **Network Structures:**
   - Provide configurations for both Feedforward and SOM networks for each problem.
   - Justify the decisions made in designing the network structures.

4. **Network Training:**
   - Specify the chosen algorithms and learning parameters for training the networks.
   - Present the achieved results and provide reasoning for the decisions made during training.

5. **Results:**
   - Evaluate the obtained results, including accuracy, precision, complexity, and convergence.
   - If applicable, present and interpret the ROC curve.

6. **Parameter Tuning:**
   - Discuss the critical aspect of fine-tuning parameters.
   - Describe changes made, their effects, and the reasoning behind them.

7. **Summary:**
   - Conclude the experiments by summarizing the results for each of the four networks.
   - Compare the results pairwise for datasets and network types.
   - Draw insights and conclusions based on the achieved outcomes.
