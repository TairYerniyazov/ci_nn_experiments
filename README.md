# Neural Network Experiments

This project contains the implementation, description, and results of four experiments involving Feedforward and Self-Organizing Map (SOM) neural networks. The experiments are conducted on two selected datasets: Palmer Penguins and Heart Disease.

# Evolutionary Algorithm Experiments

This project aims to optimize the placement of containers within a given area, considering four types of containers: residential, kitchen, sanitation, and communal space. The goal is to maximize the number of residential modules while ensuring efficient access to sanitation, kitchen, communal areas, and a clear passage.
